Fi
==

**Fi** stands for fancy indexing ([Apache Module mod_autoindex](http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.0/mod/mod_autoindex.html#indexoptions)). It makes default directory listing index pages look nice. Fi is fluid and not fixed. It is a minimalist mod of [Windex](https://github.com/desandro/windex) without PHP or gaudy icons. Fi is clear as gray â€“ a calmative index for stressed eyes. It is optimized for modern Web browsers and mobile devices.


Beware
------

Enabling directory indexes on a live site can be a serious security risk.  
**Be sure to enable Fi only where you want all the child directories and files to be viewable!**
